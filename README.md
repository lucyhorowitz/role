# Noncontractive implication-space semantics

Code related to a non-contractive version of implication-space semantics from [Reasons for Logic, Logic for Reasons](https://www.routledge.com/Reasons-for-Logic-Logic-for-Reasons-Pragmatics-Semantics-and-Conceptual-Roles/Hlobil-Brandom/p/book/9781032360768?srsltid=AfmBOoplpor3txK6IAtez79PrJoYYraOi3I9mZ9_dybTk-RWkDJcO8M3). 

## Files

- `ImplFrame.py`: contains the main `ImplicationFrame` class and associated functions.
- `drhagen/`: contains code from select parts of [this repository](https://github.com/drhagen/pairing?tab=readme-ov-file) for encoding implications as tuples and integers.
- `examples.py` contains a few examples of implication frames and some associated computations.
- `multiset.py` contanis a few helper functions for performing operations on multisets of bearers.
- `translate.py` contains a few helper functions for translating implications as strings into their encodings and vice-versa.
